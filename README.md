# âœ¨ String Functions in SQL  

String functions in SQL are used to **manipulate, format, and analyze character data**.  
They help in transforming text values, cleaning unwanted spaces, extracting substrings, and preparing data for reports or analysis.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Notes  
- The **names of string functions differ** across databases (MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL).  
- They are widely used for **data cleaning, text formatting, substring extraction, and report generation**.  
- Mastering these functions helps in **writing efficient queries** and working with text-based data.

## ðŸš€ Use Cases  
- Cleaning unwanted spaces from user input fields.  
- Extracting domains from email addresses.  
- Formatting names and addresses in reports.  
- Searching for patterns inside text data.  
- Creating well-structured output for dashboards and analytics.
